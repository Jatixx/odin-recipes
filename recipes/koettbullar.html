    <h2>What are Köttbullar?</h2>
    <p>Köttbullar are traditional Swedish meatballs that are fried, typically prepared with lingonberry compote or jam, cream sauce and boiled or mashed potatoes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>meatballs:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g grounded beef</li>
        <li>250g grounded pork</li>
        <li>1 choped onion</li>
        <li>1 choped garlic</li>
        <li>100g breadcrums</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>oil</li>
        <li>40g butter</li>
        <li>40g wheat flour</li>
        <li>150ml vegetable stock</li>
        <li>150ml beef stock</li>
        <li>150ml heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon-mustard</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soi sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the two types of ground beef and pork with your hands so that there are no lumps. Then add the onion, garlic, breadcrumbs and egg and mix well. Finally add the milk and season well with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Form small, round balls out of the mixture. Place them on a plate and chill in the fridge for 2 hours, covered – this will help them keep their shape later when cooking.</li>
        <li>Heat some oil in a pan on medium-high. Add the balls and fry until brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>When the balls are browned, take them out of the pan and cook them in an ovenproof dish, covered, in the oven for about 30 minutes at 180 degrees top/bottom heat or at 160 degrees convection.</li>
        <li>For the sauce, melt the butter in a small saucepan, add the flour with a whisk, and stir for about 2 minutes. Then add the vegetable and beef broth while stirring. Now stir in the crème double, the mustard and the soy sauce and let the sauce simmer until it is creamy.</li>
    </ol>
